Stock Portfolio Analysis using FinQuant 

FinQuant is a program for financial portfolio management, analysis and optimisation.
It is designed to generate an object that holds your data, e.g. stock prices of different stocks,
which automatically computes the most common quantities, such as Expected annual Return, 
Volatility and Sharpe Ratio. Moreover, it provides a library for computing different kinds of Returns 
and visualising Moving Averages and Bollinger Bands. Finally, given a set of stocks, it also allows for 
finding optimised portfolios.
