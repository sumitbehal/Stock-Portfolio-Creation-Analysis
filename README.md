Stock Portfolio Analysis using FinQuant 

FinQuant is a program for financial portfolio management, analysis and optimisation.
It is designed to generate an object that holds your data, e.g. stock prices of different stocks,
which automatically computes the most common quantities, such as Expected annual Return, 
Volatility and Sharpe Ratio. Moreover, it provides a library for computing different kinds of Returns 
and visualising Moving Averages and Bollinger Bands. Finally, given a set of stocks, it also allows for 
finding optimised portfolios.

Let's define the portfolio's elements which we have some control over them:

Capital: The amount of money we have available to invest or speculate.
Instruments: These are the assets available for inclusion in our portfolio management strategy.
Currency: The currency in which the asset is traded. When we invest in an asset denominated in a foreign currency, we assume the foreign exchange risk.
Volatility: Also called asset risk, indicates the movement of the asset for the period analysed.
Cost: Amount of money needed to buy/sell-short an asset.
Liquidity: It is the capacity of the asset to absorb our operations.
Rules: These are the strategies that try to take advantage of some market regime.
Position weight: The amount of capital we allocate to each asset and/or strategy.
Return: Absolute returns are the return of our portfolio and relative returns are the return of our portfolio compared to a benchmark. When we are not comparing our returns with anybody, absolute return is a good measure, but when we need to compare performances we use the relative return.
Risk or Volatility: This is the (estimated) amount that the portfolio assumes
